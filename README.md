# Airfare-price-prediction
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The flight ticket buying system is to purchase a ticket many days prior to flight take-off so as to stay away from the effect of the
most extreme charge. Mostly, aviation routes don’t agree this procedure. Plane organizations may diminish the cost at the time, they
need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less accessible. They may maximize the costs. So, the cost may rely
upon different factors. To foresee the costs this venture uses AI to exhibit the ways of flight tickets after some time. All
organizations have the privilege and opportunity to change its ticket costs at any time. Explorer can set aside cash by booking a
ticket at the least costs. People who had travelled by flight frequently are aware of price fluctuations. The airlines use complex
policies of Revenue Management for execution of distinctive evaluating systems. The evaluating system as a result changes the
charge depending on time, season, and festive days to change the header or footer on successive pages. The ultimate aim of the
airways is to earn profit whereas the customer searches for the minimum rate. Customers usually try to buy the ticket well in
advance of departure date so as to avoid hike in airfare as date comes closer. But actually, this is not the fact. The customer may
wind up by giving more than they ought to for the same seat.</p>
<h2>Existing system:</h2>
<p>Nowadays there are lots of apps for flight ticket booking.if passenger want to travel from one space to another space so they don’t know actually what is the prices of that same space flight. In existing system manpower required to get the flight fair and it is costliest process.</p>
<h2>Disadvanatges:</h2>
<p>High cost</p>
<h2>Proposed system:</h2>
<p>The tourists who want to visit a new place should know the fare price tag rate in order to get the cheapest and certain price tag rate with their needs. That’s why we decided this project. In this project we will going to use machine Learning as back end. Flask as a python framework. Front end . Flask is nothing but one of the Python Framework.</p>
<h2>Advantages:</h2>
<p>Low cost compare to existing system.</p>
